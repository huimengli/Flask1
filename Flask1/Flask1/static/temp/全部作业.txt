   题 41 - 45  
 Passage 1 
    There are some very good things about open education. This way of teaching allows the students to grow as people develop their own interests in many subjects. Open education allows students to be responsible for their own education, as they are responsible for what they do in life. Some students do badly in a traditional classroom. The open classroom may allow them to enjoy learning. Some students will be happier in an open education school. They will not have to worry about grades or rules. For students who worry about these things a lot, it is a good idea to be in an open classroom.
     But many students will not do well in an open classroom. For some students, there are too few rules. These students will do little in school. They will not make good use of open education. Because open education is so different from traditional education, these students may have a problem getting used to making so many choices. For many students it is important to have some rules in the classroom. They worry about the rules even when there are no rules. Even a few rules will help this kind of student. The last point about open education is that some traditional teachers do not like it. Many teachers do not believe in open education. Teachers who want to have an open classroom may have many problems at their schools.
     You now know what open education is. Some of its good points and bad points have been explained. You may have your own opinion about open education. The writer thinks that open education is a good idea, but only in theory. In actual fact, it may not work very well in a real class or school. The writer believes that most students, but of course not all students, want some structure in their classes. They want to have rules. In some cases, they must be made to study some subjects. Many students are pleased to find subjects they have to study interesting. They would not study those subjects if they did not have to.  41. Open education allows the students to ____. 
[A]  grow as the educated 
[B]  be responsible for their future 
[C]  develop their own interests

   题 46 - 50  
 Passage 2 
    Are you looking for a good book to read? Do you need information about universities in the United States? Do you want to know the correct price of a used car? Would you like to read newspapers and magazines from different countries? Do you need a quiet place to study? Did you answer "yes" to any of these questions? Then you should visit "the information place" -- your local library.
     A library is more than just a place where books are stored. A library is a source of information. That information may come from books (fiction, nonfiction, or reference books), from periodicals (newspapers, magazines, and journals), from audio-visual material (records, cassettes microfilm, video tapes, etc.) or even from a computer terminal.
     Students go to libraries to study and to write research papers. The periodicals room of a university library is where foreign students often find newspapers and magazines from their countries. In the reference room, they can find catalogs from many universities in the U.S. and other countries. If you are buying a used car, the reference librarian can show you the Blue Book, which lists the prices of new and used cars. People who need information in a burry can telephone the reference librarian at many libraries.
     There are as many different library services as there are types of people who use them. Children's libraries provide materials for young readers. They sometimes have storytellers who read stories to groups of children, and a few have computers for the children to play with. Music lovers can listen to recordings of their favorite musicians in music libraries. Some libraries have painting and sculpture exhibits, and most libraries offer special services for blind people, such as books in Braille, "talking" books, and Kurzweil Reading Machines.
     Libraries provide entertainment as well as information. Novels and short stories from a library's fiction collection are a good source of enjoyable reading practice. Public libraries often sponsor lectures on topics of interest to members of the community, and a few even offer concerts and films. No matter what your interests are, you will find that a library can be a great place to enjoy yourself while you learn.  46. What is another name for a library?____ 
[A]  A bookstore.

   题 51 - 55  
 Passage 3 
    Acting is such an over-crowded profession that the only advice that should be given to a young person thinking of going on the stage is "Don't!" But it is useless to try to discourage someone who feels that he must act, although the chances of his becoming famous are small. The normal way to begin is to go to a drama school. Usually only students who show promise and talent are accepted, and the course lasts two years. Then the young actor or actress takes up work with a repertory company, usually as an assistant stage manager. This means doing everything that there is to do in the theatre: painting scenery, looking after the furniture, publicity, taking care of the costumes, and even acting in very small parts. It is very hard work indeed, the hours are long and the salary is tiny. But young actors with the stage in their blood are happy, waiting for the chance of work with a better company, or perhaps in films or television.
     Of course, some people have remarkable chances which lead to fame and success without this long and tedious training. Connie Pratt, for example, was just an ordinary girl working in a bicycle factory. A film producer happened to catch sight of her one morning waiting at a bus stop, as he drove past in his big car. He told the chauffeur to stop, and he got out to speak to the girl. He asked her if she would like to go to the film studio to do a test, and at first she thought he was joking. Then she got angry and said she would call the police. It took t he producer twenty minutes to convince Connie that he was serious. Then an appointment was made for her to go to the studio the next day. The test was successful. They gave her elocution lessons and within a few weeks she was playing the leading part opposite one of the most famous actors of the day. Of course, she was given a more dramatic name, which is now world-famous. But chances like this happen once in a blue moon!  51. The reason why young people should be discouraged from becoming actors is that ____. 
[A]  actors are very determined people 
[B]  the course at the drama school lasts two years 
[C]  acting is very hard work 
[D]  there are already too many actors

   题 41 - 45  
 Passage 1 
    A few years ago it was fashionable to speak of a generation gap, a division between young people and their elders. Parents complained that children did not show them proper respect and obedience, while children complained that their parents did not understand them at all. What had gone wrong? Why had the generation gap suddenly appeared? Actually, the generation gap has been around for a long time. Many critics argue that it is built into the fabric of our society.
     One important cause of the generation gap is the opportunity that young people have to choose their won life-styles. In more traditional societies, when children grow up, they are expected to live in the same area as their parents, to marry people that their parents know and approve of, and often to continue the family occupation. In our society, young people often travel great distances for their educations, move out of the family home at an early age, marry--or live with--people whom their parents have never met, and choose occupations different from those of their parents.
     In our upwardly mobile society, parents often expect their children to do better than they did: to find better jobs, to make more money, and to do all the things that they were unable to do. Often, however, the ambitions that parents have for their children are another cause of the division between them. Often, they discover that they have very little in common with each other.
     Finally, the speed at which changes take place in our society is another cause of the gap between the generations. In a traditional culture, elderly people are valued for their wisdom, but in our society the knowledge of a lifetime may become obsolete overnight. The young and the old seem to live in two very different worlds, separated by different skills and abilities.
     No doubt, the generation gap will continue to be a feature of American life for some time to come. Its causes are rooted in the freedoms and opportunities of our society, and in the rapid pace at which society changes. √ 41. The main idea of the first paragraph is that ____. 
[A]  the generation gap suddenly appeared 
[B]  the generation gap is a feature of American life 
[C]  how people can reduce the generation gap 
[D]  many critics argue over the nature of the generation gap

 Passage 2 
    A Good Heart to Lean On
     More than I realized, Dad has helped me keep my balance.
    Augustus J. Bullock
     When I was growing up, I was embarrassed to be seen with my father. He was severely crippled and very short, and when we would walk together, his hand on my arm for balance, people would stare. I would be ashamed of the unwanted attention. If he ever noticed or was bothered, he never let on.
     It was difficult to coordinate our steps―his halting, mine impatient1―and because of that, we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out, he always said, "You set the pace. I will try to adjust to you."
     Our usual walk was to or from the subway, which was how he got to work. He went to work sick, and despite nasty weather. He almost never missed a day, and would make it to the office even if others could not. It was a matter of pride for him.
     When snow or ice was on the ground, it was impossible for him to walk, even with help. At such times my sisters or I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., on a child's sleigh to the subway entrance. Once there, he would cling to the handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice-free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building, and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home.
     When I think of it now, I marvel at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to subject himself to such indignity and stress. And I marvel at how he did it―without bitterness or complaint.
     He never talked about himself as an object of pity, nor did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able. What he looked for in others was a "good heart", and if he found one, the owner was good enough for him.
     Now that I am older, I believe that is a proper standard by which to judge people, even though I still don't know precisely what a "good heart" is. But I know the times I don't have one myself.
     Unable to engage in many activities, my father still tried to participate in some way. When a local baseball team found itself without a manager, he kept it going. He was a knowledgeable baseball fan and often took me to Ebbets Field to see the Brooklyn Dodgers play. He liked to go to dances and parties, where he could have a good time just sitting and watching. 
     On one memorable occasion a fight broke out at a beach party, with everyone punching and shoving. He wasn't content to sit and watch, but he couldn't stand unaided on the soft sand. In frustration he began to shout, "I'll fight anyone who will sit down with me! I'11 fight anyone who will sit down with me!"
     Nobody did. But the next day people kidded him by saying it was the first time any fighter was urged to take a dive2 even before the bout began.
     I now know he participated in some things vicariously through me, his only son. When I played ball (poorly), he "played" too. When I joined the Navy, he "joined" too. And when I came home on leave, he saw to it that3 I visited his office. Introducing me, he was really saying, "This is my son, but it is also me, and I could have done this, too, if things had been different." Those words were never said aloud.
     He has been gone many years now, but I think of him often. I wonder if he sensed my reluctance to be seen with him during our walks. If he did, I am sorry I never told him how sorry I was, how unworthy I was, how I regretted it. I think of him when I complain about trifles, when I am envious of another's good fortune, when I don't have a "good heart".
     At such times I put my hand on his arm to regain my balance, and say, "You set the pace. I will try to adjust to you."
    (703 words) √ 46. The son was embarrassed to be seen with his father because ____. 
[A]  his father was shorter than he

 [56]. 当地面上有冰雪的时候，即使有人帮忙，他也无法行走。这种时候我或者我的姐妹们会拉着他穿过纽约布鲁克林的街道，坐着儿童雪橇来到地铁口。一到那里，他就紧紧的抓住扶手，直到走到较低的台阶，
【参考答案】：
    当地上有雪或冰的时候，即使有人帮忙他也无法走路。这时，我或者我的姐妹就用孩子玩的雪橇拉着他，穿过纽约布鲁克林的街道，直到地铁的入口处。一到那儿，他就能紧紧抓住扶手一直走下去，因为地铁通道里比较暖和，下面的楼梯不结冰。曼哈顿的地铁站正好是他办公楼的地下室，因此在我们去布鲁克林接他回家之前，他都不用再出去。
   5 一个成年男子要有多少勇气才能承受这种屈辱和压力，我现在想来都惊讶不已。他从没有因此而痛苦或抱怨，我对他是如何做到这一点的感到不可思议。
   6 他从不把自己当作被同情的对象，也从不嫉妒比自己幸运或能干的人。他在别人身上所寻找的是一颗“善心”。如果他找到了一颗善心，那么有这样一颗心的人对他来说就是一位大好人了。
   7 随着年龄的增长，我相信那是一种用来判断人的恰当的标准，尽管我还不能确切地知道什么是一颗“善心”。但是，当我自己没有的时候，我是知道的。

 Passage 1 
    Lane waited on the bench nearest the bridge, as he had been instructed. The strong cold wind blew straight across the river, and he had to pull his overcoat closer about him.
     He went over his instructions in his mind. The agent would appear at four o'clock. He would chat to Lane for a while, after which he would get up, leaving his newspaper behind. The plans would be found inside.
     A distant clock began to strike the hour. As if from nowhere, a man appeared and sat down beside Lane, placing his newspaper on the seat between them. He was thin and middle-aged, and seemed in need of a good meal. He didn't look like a successful spy, Lane thought. He bore no resemblance to Lane's idea of a successful spy. His conversation about the weather was painfully uninteresting.
     A few minutes later he got up and continued on his way. Lane picked up the paper which lay on the bench, as if he wanted to look at the news. He was excited to see the plans, pinned to the centre page. At that moment, however, there was a strong gust of wind which lifted the newspaper into the air, like a kite, and blew it into the river. × 1. Sitting on the bench, Lane ____.

   题 6 - 10  
 Passage 2 
    Cross was what people call a mystery man. We had known him for over five years, ever since he became a member of our modest club, but he had a way of keeping his private life to himself in all but unessential details. We knew his address, though he did not ever invite us to his home, and his age too, but only insignificant matters of this kind. It appeared that he did not have to work for a living as we did, in our various ways. He had once hinted at an inheritance on which he managed to live comfortably. He was not, however, a man of luxurious habits: he was not especially well-dressed and he did not even have a car. At the age of forty-five he was still a bachelor though, since marriage was not a subject he ever discussed, we had no means of finding out whether he regretted the lack of a wife.
     Cross disappeared suddenly from our circle and shortly after we came to learn the first really solid facts about our mystery man. From reports that appeared in the newspapers, accompanied by photographs of a man who was, without any doubt, our Mr. Cross, it was discovered that he was a most accomplished burglar, operating chiefly in the London area; and that he had practiced this profession for many years, until he was arrested and sent to prison. × 6.

   题 11 - 15  
 Passage 3 
    John had bought a packet of cigarettes just before we caught the train and he offered me one as we settled ourselves in our compartment (车厢). We were on our way back from a camping holiday; we had lived rough for over two weeks and even a cigarette was a luxury at that moment.
     I felt in my pocket for a box of matches, but could not find any.
     "I haven't got any either," said John.
     Sitting opposite to us was a man whose face was hidden by a newspaper.
     "Excuse me, sir," said John, leaning across. "Could you give me a light, please?"
     The newspaper was lowered to reveal a rather elderly man with a stern face.
     "This is a no smoking compartment," the man said. He indicated the notice near the window. We apologized and put away our cigarettes. The man went on, in a rather more kindly way, to warn us against the dangers of smoking.
     "I speak as a doctor," he concluded, and after that he went back to reading his newspaper.
     When he got out a few stations later, he left his newspaper behind him. We picked it up, eager to find out what had happened while we were on holiday.
     "Just look at this," remarked John, pointing to a photograph. "It's the man who was sitting opposite us." Underneath the photograph was an account of a lunatic(精神病者) who had recently escaped. It appeared that he liked to pretend to be a doctor. √ 11. The friends had spent their holiday ____.

   题 16 - 35  
 Passage 1 
    Nearly three-quarters of the Earth is covered with water. Water heats up more slowly than land, but once it has become warm it takes longer to    16    down. If the Earth's surface were entirely land, the temperature at night would    17    quite quickly and night would be much colder than day, as it is on the moon. This does    18    happen in inland deserts, hundreds of miles from any sea. The climate of the continents, especially in the temperate    19   , is very much affected by the oceans around them. The areas close to the sea have a ‘maritime climate',    20    rather cool summers and warm winters. The interiors, far from the sea, have a ‘   21    climate' with extremely hot summers and cold winters.
     Rain    22    from the evaporation of rivers, seas and lakes. Even after heavy rain, the pavements in a city do not take long to dry    23    the rainwater evaporates into the air. On a warm dry day it evaporates very rapidly,    24    warm air can take in more moisture than cold air. But at any particular temperature, the    25    can hold only a certain maximum amount of water vapour. The air is then saturated, like a sponge that cannot hold    26    more water. The lower the temperature, the   27    water vapour is required to saturate the air.
     All over the surface of the Earth, millions of tons of water are    28    every second, condensing in the air into drops so small    29    it takes thousands of them to make a single raindrop. It is these    30    drops that make clouds. When clouds roll in from the sea over the warmer land, they are forced to    31    and become cooler in the colder upper atmosphere. As the air cools down it may pass through its saturation point and    32    some of its water vapour turns to rain. Day in, day out, the    33    water circulates between the air and the land: rivers    34    to make clouds, clouds make rain, rain makes rivers which in turn run into the sea. This is called the rain    35   . × 16.

   题 1 - 5  
 Passage 1 
    The greatest recent social changes have been in the lives of women. During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century world probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which custom, opportunity and health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has the care of children, her work is lightened by household appliances and convenience foods.
     The important change in women's life-pattern has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls left school at the first opportunity, and most of them took a full-time job. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school-leaving age is sixteen, many girls stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Very many more afterwards return to full or part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money, and running the home, according to the abilities and interests of each of them. × 1. For women at the beginning of the twentieth century, the amount of time spent taking care of children ____. 
[A]  was shorter than in previous centuries 
[B]  was longer than in previous centuries

 Passage 2 
    Two thousand million people around the world currently have highly infectious liver disease, hepatitis B. Until now effective treatment has not been available but recent trials using a plant extract have produced promising results.
     Hepatitis B currently kills 2 million people each year and ten per cent of survivors remain carriers. Some of these people may later die from cancer of the liver. In the Third World, where hepatitis B is most prevalent, very little treatment is available.
     Now there is some hope. Researchers in Madras (India) and Philadelphia (USA. have been testing an ancient herbal remedy (草药治疗). Plants of the genus phyllanthus have been widely used for over 2,000 years as a treatment for jaundice. In the trials, thirty-seven hepatitis carriers were given capsules containing an extract of the plant, while twenty-three took capsules containing only a type of sugar. After thirty days, twenty-two of those treated with the plant extract no longer had the virus, while only one of those given sugar was free of it. Nine months after the trials, the virus had not returned to any of those patients who had been cured. Most of the patients who were given plant extract but were not free of the virus had received treatment when they were in the early stages of the disease, when it spreads very quickly. Researchers believe that they too could be helped with higher doses and longer courses of treatment. These results are encouraging, especially as the plant extract appears to have no harmful side effects. √ 6. What is the best title for this passage? ____ 
[A]  Old Cures Are Sometimes the Best. 
[B]  Hepatitis B is Never Cured. 
[C]  Hepatitis B in the Third World.

   题 11 - 15  
 Passage 3 
    Under proper conditions, sound waves will be reflected from a hillside or other such obstruction. Sound travels at the rate of about one fifth of a mile per second. If the hill is eleven hundred feet away, it takes two seconds for the sound to travel to the hill and back. Thus, by timing the interval between a sound and its reflection (the echo), you can estimate the distance to an obstruction.
     During World War Ⅱ the British used a practical application of this principle to detect German planes on their way to bomb London long before the enemy was near the target. They used radio waves instead of sound waves, since radio waves can penetrate fog and clouds. The outnumbered Royal Air Force (RAF) always seemed to the puzzled Germans to be lying in wait at the right time and never to be surprised. It was radio echoes more than anything else that won the battle of Britain.
     Since the radio waves were used to tell the direction in which to send the RAF planes and the distance to send them (Their range of light, in other words), the device was called radio directing and ranging, and from the initials the word radar (雷达) was coined. √ 11. Sound waves reflected from a hill can be used to estimate the ____. 
[A]  height of the hill 
[B]  speed of sound 
[C]  distance to the hill

   题 16 - 35  
 Passage 1 
    The idea of having a hobby    16    your leisure hours, of taking    17    a pastime to keep you    18    and busy when you're not    19    work, is quite common in Britain, but it's by no    20    a worldwide habit. There are many countries where people spend their free time    21    resting and talking. 
     When people are asked why they go    22    for a particular hobby they often give very different    23   . Some say that they feel they    24    to do something useful in their spare time;    25    talk about self-improvement and the    26    of learning to do something new. A popular explanation    27    having a hobby is that it offers a chance to do    28    completely different from one's    29    work; some people say that their hobby,    30    it's an outdoor hobby, has been a means of making new    31    and exchanging ideas. There are those,    32   , who say they're bored    33    their jobs and feel the    34    for a more constructive activity when they're    35    duty. √ 16.

   题 1 - 5  
 Passage 1 
    American this year will swallow 15,000 tons of aspirin, one of the safest and most effective drugs invented by man. The most popular medicine in the world today, it is an effective pain reliever. Its bad effects are relatively mild, and it is cheap.
     For millions of people suffering from arthritis (关节炎), it is the only thing that works. Aspirin, in short, is truly the 20th-century wonder drug. It is also the second largest suicide drug and is the leading cause of poisoning among children. It has side effects that although relatively mild are largely unrecognized among users.
     Although aspirin was first sold by a German company in 1899, it has been around much longer than that. Hippocrates, in ancient Greece, understood the medical value of the leaves and tree bark which today are known to contain salicylates, the chemical in aspirin. During the 19th century, there was a great deal of experimentation in Europe with this chemical, and it led to the introduction of aspirin. By 1915, aspirin tablets were available in the United States.
     A small quantity of aspirin (two five-grain tablets) relieves pain and inflammation (发炎). It also reduces fever by interfering with some of the body's reactions. Specifically, aspirin seems to slow down the formation of the acids involved in pain and the complex chemical reactions that cause fever. The chemistry of these acids is not fully understood, but the slowing effect of aspirin is well known.
     Aspirin is very irritating to the stomach lining, and many aspirin takers complain about upset stomach. There is a right way and a wrong way to take aspirin. The best way is to chew the tablets before swallowing them with water, but few people can stand the bitter taste. Some people suggest crushing the tablets in milk or orange juice and drinking that. × 1. This passage discusses ____. 
[A]  only the good things about aspirin 
[B]  only the bad things about aspirin 
[C]  both the good and bad things about aspirin 
[D]  neither the good things nor the bad things about aspirin

   题 6 - 10  
 Passage 2 
    According to a study by the National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities, only half of the families whose children expect to go to college are saving toward the expense. If they had saved just $20 a week at a low five-percent annual interest rate from when the child was born, they'd have more than $30,000 by the time the child reached 18.
     There is popular misunderstanding that if you save, you won't get the financial aid. But a close analysis of the FFS and FAF formula proves that saving sufficient sums of money for college can have only a minor impact on your aid package ― if done correctly.
     Savings should be in the parents' names. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the advantage of putting savings in a child's name. And, under the present aid formula, a maximum of only 12 percent of the savings and other assets (资产) owned by the parents go toward figuring the expected family contribution. However, 35 percent of the student's savings and assets are calculated in.
     The best way to save is to treat a set amount each week or month as though it was just another bill or tax that comes right off the top of the paycheck. If you try to save what is left after bills are paid, you'll have a much tougher time.
     If you are a member of a credit union, consider putting your money in a savings account there. Such accounts usually pay interest rates one to two percentage points higher than those at a bank. √ 6. This passage is most probably directed at ____. 
[A]  parents with children going to attend universities 
[B]  high school students 
[C]  college students 
[D]  high school teachers

√ 7. Half of the families don't save up money for college study because ____. 
[A]  they don't have the extra money

[D]  they want to do other investments

√ 8. Which is NOT one of the reasons that the savings should be in the parents' names? ____ 
[A]  Savings in the children's names no longer enables the parents to pay less tax under the new tax law.

[C]  A maximum of only 12 percent of the parents' savings and assets are counted in when the family financial support is measured.

   题 11 - 15  
 Passage 3 
    There is a widespread belief that people who get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it, but because of influential friends or the right background. Sometimes it may just be a comforting and harmless belief, while at the other extreme it can be very destructive. I once met a brilliant young engineer who worked in a chemical plant. Because of her knowledge and experience, she should have been promoted to Production Manager. Instead, the job went to a man who was totally unsuited for the post. Everyone knew that he only got it because he was politically acceptable to his superiors. This injustice demoralized the young engineer and many of her colleagues. It also meant that the factory was much less efficient than it could have been.
     All the same, we should not be pessimistic. More and more, the modern world depends on having people who are in the job because they are good enough, not just because their face fits. There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine, which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped it, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, "This can't be right! $100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?" The engineer wrote out a new bill: "For tapping a machine, $1; for knowing where to tap it, $99." √ 11. It is believed that some people have succeeded in life because____. 
[A]  they feel superior to others 
[B]  they are both influential and powerful 
[C]  they have some special advantages 
[D]  they have a poor background 
【参考答案】：C 
【干扰项】：该题没有学生选择了错误答案！ 
 
【题目解析】：本题测试辨认信息的能力。文章第一句说“有个广为流传的信仰认为人获得成功并不是因为他值得，而是因为有影响力的朋友或是有背景”。选项C提到有特殊的优势与文意最接近。A项与D项都明显不对，B项是说“他们有影响力和权利”与文中意思不符。 

√ 12. The engineer at the chemical plant was not promoted because____. 
[A]  it is more difficult for a woman to get a promotion than for her male colleagues 
[B]  her boss did not think she had the right qualifications for the job 
[C]  the man who got his promotion was more experienced than she was 
[D]  her bosses did not approve of her political views and opinions 
【参考答案】：D 
【干扰项】：该题没有学生选择了错误答案！ 
 
【题目解析】：本题是测试对原文的细节的理解。在文章第一段找到“…he only got it because he was politically acceptable to his superiors．”选项D说“她老板不接受她的政治观点和看法”，所以是正确的。 

√ 13. The engineer who repaired the machine was right to charge $100 because____. 
[A]  he was the only person who could find out what was wrong with it 
[B]  the factory owner could not have repaired it himself 
[C]  he hit the machine to get it started again 
[D]  he was charging for his knowledge and expert skills 
【参考答案】：D 
【干扰项】：该题没有学生选择了错误答案！ 
 
【题目解析】：本题测试对文中所举的例子的理解。例子是为了说明知识能力的价值，所以D选项是对的。 

× 14. The author's attitude toward the widespread belief is____. 
[A]  positive 
[B]  negative 
[C]  neutral 
[D]  sympathetic 
【参考答案】：B 
【干扰项】：C（有100.00%的学生选择了该选项） 
 
【题目解析】：本题是测试对作者的观点的理解。从文章第二段的大意所举的例子可看出作者并不认同那广泛流传的信仰。答案A是“肯定”，B是“否定”，C是“中立”，D是“同情”，正确应为B。 

√ 15. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT TRUE?____ 
[A]  Having influential friends or right background seems helpful sometimes. 
[B]  The engineer had good reason to overcharge the factory owner. 
[C]  Not all those who are good in their jobs have the chance to be promoted. 
[D]  Those who are good in their job are still largely needed by the modern society. 
【参考答案】：B 
【干扰项】：A（有50.00%的学生选择了该选项） 
 
【题目解析】：本题是测试对文章句子的理解。B选项说“那工程师有很好的理由要高价”与文中不符，并不是要价过高，而是那是他的知识能力的应得的价值。

The increasing popularity of the Internet has brought about significant social changes. Chinese netizens tend to differ from their American counterparts in that the latter are more motivated by practical needs such as using the Net to send emails, buy and sell, conduct research, plan a trip, or pay bills. The former, however, use the Net more often for social interactions, thus making more extensive use of forums, blogs, and chat rooms.

  Directions:In this section there are some passages. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements with four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You are supposed to read the passage and make the best choice to complete each question or unfinished statement. Then type the answer in the blank on the web page.[题数：15；分数：30分；参考时间：30分0秒]
 
   题 1 - 5  
 Passage 1 
    Have you ever suddenly felt that someone you knew was in trouble -- and he was? Have you ever dreamed something that came true later? Maybe you have ESP (超感官知觉).
     ESP stands for Extrasensory Perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away.
     Here's an example: A woman was ironing clothes. Suddenly she screamed, "My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!" Just then, a telegram came. The woman's father had died of a heart attack. He had died sitting in a chair.
     There are thousands of stories like this one on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what's behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example -- one of hundreds of dreams that have come true:
     A man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and carriage came by. The driver said, "There's room for one more". The man felt the driver was Death, so he ran away. The next day, the man was getting on a crowded bus. The bus driver said, "There's room for one more". Then the man saw that the driver's face was the same face he had seen in the dream. He wouldn't get on the bus. As the bus drove off, it crashed and burst into flames. Everyone was killed!
     Some people say stories like these are lies or coincidences. Others, including some scientists, say that ESP is real. From studies of ESP, we may someday learn more about the human mind. √ 1. The best title for this selection is ____. 
[A]  The Human Mind

   题 6 - 10  
 Passage 2 
    Where can a sick person go to find out what is wrong with him? A clinic. Where can a sick car be taken if its owner wants to know what is wrong with it? That's right -- a clinic. Auto clinics are a new and growing business. There are now more than 40 auto clinics in the U.S. Many more will be built in the next few years.
     How does a clinic work? A car is put on rollers that turn slowly, then faster. As the car is driven forward, the rollers turn backward. So the car is driven without going anywhere. Meanwhile a group of mechanics gives the car more than 100 tests with the latest equipment. The car climbs an imaginary hill and screeches to an imaginary stop. Everything is checked, from wheel balance to brakes.
     After the checkup, the owner is told what is ailing his car had what it might cost for repairs. The checkup itself costs $5.95. The owner can have the repairs done anywhere. Most customers have them done at the clinic.
     Why do car owners often prefer these clinics to service stations? "A car goes through a lot," a clinic owner said. "Anything that is wrong with it will have to show up. In a clinic, there's no guessing about it. Now car repairs are scientific." A car owner said, "A mechanic might have fooled around for two weeks without finding what the clinic uncovered in half an hour." √ 6. The author's purpose is ____. 
[A]  to ask for safer cars 
[B]  to warn against dishonest mechanics 
[C]  to describe how auto clinics work 
[D]  to tell you the cost of an auto clinic checkup

   题 11 - 15  
 Passage 3 
    Do you know how astronauts eat while whirling through space? Their food comes in plastic tubes, and they eat it from the tubes. Why? Spacecraft food must be light and easy to store. It must also be non-spoilable. Many of the foods made for eating in a spaceship have been a success. In fact, everyone may soon be able to have them!
     Scientists have learned to keep some foods from spoiling by removing the oxygen from them. This is done by pumping nitrogen gas into them, forcing nearly all the oxygen out. Without oxygen, bacteria cannot grow -- not can the foods spoil.
     Freeze-drying is another way to keep food from spoiling. First the foods are frozen. Then they are dried. Fruits, vegetables, meat and even ice cream can be freeze-dried. Years later, you can just add milk or water, and they're ready to be eaten. And freeze-dried foods need no refrigeration!
     Besides non-spoilable foods, scientists can now make foods from non-food materials. Coal, gas, and other non-foods have been turned into foods. By treating these materials with bacteria, scientists can produce rich proteins.
     Experts say that four out of five of the world's people do not eat enough protein. Man-made proteins could help people in needy areas. But it should be a long time before any of us sit down to a bowl of coal and a glass of gas. × 11. The best title for this selection is ____. 
[A]  Food from Coal and Gas 
[B]  Non-Spoiling and New Foods

   题 16 - 35  
 Passage 1 
    Jounalists and TV people, we know, are    16    to record what goes on. but in trying to get the best    17    they can, they may sometimes seem amazingly cold-blooded. In the massacre that followed the British quitting India,    18    was a photographer who made a sorrowing Indian family bury and rebury    19    dead several times    20    he got a perfect shot. A BBC sound man held up a Nigerian execution for half an hour while he adjusted his sound equipment; you could say it didn't    21    any difference to the final outcome, but it doesn't make you feel especially warm towards the man    22   . 
     Should jounalists and photographers join in,    23    just stand back and watch while people kill    24    another? It's a tricky question, not just a    25    of how brave anyone is feeling at the time,    26    without authentic pictures, how will the world know, how should the world believe    27    crimes are committed? One dead photographer does not do much for the cause he cares about, even    28    he did feel forced to join in and take sides.
     To stay out of the fight, to write    29    what's going on, to treat    30    with both sides, as a doctor will cure soldiers in    31    uniform or a lawyer argue for either side ― that is supposed to be our code, and when it    32    to the crutch, we probably do better trying to stick    33    that, than rushing off on individual impulse. But is there not a point in any profession    34    you are forced back against the wall    35    a human being? I think there is, and I was. √ 16.

   题 1 - 5  
 Passage 1 
    Tokyo is one of those places that you can love and hate at the same time.
     In Tokyo there are always too many people in the places where I want to be. Of course there are too many cars. The Japanese drive very fast when they can but in Tokyo they often spend a long time in traffic jams. Tokyo is not different from London, Paris and New York in that. It is different when one wants to walk.
     At certain times of the day there are a lot of people on foot in London's Oxford Street. But the streets near the Ginza in Tokyo always have a lot of people on foot, and sometimes it is really difficult to walk. People are very polite; there are just too many of them.
     The worst time to be in the street is at 11:30 at night. That is when the night-clubs are closing and everybody wants to go home. There are 35,000 night-clubs in Tokyo, and you do not often see one that is empty.
     During the day, most people travel to and from work by train. Tokyo people buy six million train tickets every day. At most stations, trains arrive every two or three minutes, but at certain hours there do not seem to be enough trains. Although they are usually crowded, Japanese trains are very good. They always leave and arrive on time. On a London train you would see everybody reading a newspaper. In Tokyo trains everybody in a seat seems to be asleep, whether his journey is long or short.
     In Tokyo, I stood outside the station for five minutes. Three fire-engines raced(疾驰) past on the way to one of the many fires that Tokyo has every day. Tokyo has so many surprises that none of them can really surprise me now. √ 1. According to the passage, Tokyo is different from London in that ____. 
[A]  it has a larger population 
[B]  it is a bigger city 
[C]  it is more difficult to go somewhere on foot

   题 6 - 10  
 Passage 2 
    About three hundred words in the English language come from the names of people. Many of these words are technical words. When there is a new invention or discovery, a new word may be created after the inventor or scientist.
     It is interesting to observe how many common words have found their way into the language from the names of people. Lord(贵族) Sandwich who lived from 1718--1792 used to sit at the gambling(赌博) table eating slices of bread with meat in between. As the Lord was the only one among his friends who ate bread in that way, his friends began to call the bread "sandwich" for fun. Later on the word became part of the English language.
     The word "boycott" means to refuse to have anything with somebody or something. It comes from a man called Captain Boycott. He was a land agent in 1880 and he collected rents and taxes (税) for an English landowner in Ireland. But the Captain was a very hard man. He treated his poor tenants (房客) very badly. His tenants decided not to speak to him at all. Eventually word got back to the landowner and the Captain was removed. The word "boycott" became popular and was used by everyone to mean the kind of treatment that was received by Captain Boycott. √ 6. A few hundred ____come from the names of people.

   题 11 - 15  
 Passage 3 
    Elderly people respond best to a calm and unhurried environment. This is not always easy to provide as their behaviour can sometimes be irritating (激怒). If they set excited or upset then they may become more confused and more difficult to look after. Although sometimes it can be extremely difficult, it is best to be patient and not to get upset yourself. You should always encourage old people to do as much as possible for themselves but be ready to lend a helping hand when necessary. At the same time it is also important that you don't make them feel like children. 
     Failing memory makes it very difficult for the person to recall all the basic kinds of information we take for granted. The obvious way to help in this situation is to supply the information that is missing and help them make sense of what is going on. The information has to be constantly repeated to make up for the poor memory. You must use every opportunity to provide information but remember to keep it simple and straightforward. 
     Confused old people need aids all the time to compensate (补偿) for their poor memory. Encourage them to use and refer to reminder boards or diaries for important forthcoming events and label (贴标签) the contents of different cupboards and drawers. √ 11. Elderly people will be most cooperative when ____. 
[A]  they are encouraged

 Passage 1 
    In the 19th century, it was common to hear people in Europe and America say that the resources of the sea were unlimited. For example, a famous biologist said    16    the mid 1800s that resources of the sea were    17   .
